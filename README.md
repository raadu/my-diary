# Introduction
This is currently just a CRUD project I created from [Net Ninja Node.js Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jsz4LDYc6kv3ymONOKxwBU). 
I will be updating it to make a Daily Diary web application. Users can add events of their everyday life. 
Will add more features later: 

- [x] Create a new blog
- [x] Show All Blogs
- [x] Show blog details
- [x] Delete a blog
- [ ] Edit a blog
- [ ] User Authentication
- [ ] Date-wise entry
- [ ] Add pictures to blog
- [ ] Blog category
- [ ] Search Option
- [ ] Blog comments

# Installation 
To run the app go to project directory and enter this command 
```
npm install
npm start
```

* Port used 3000. App is displayed in localhost:3000
